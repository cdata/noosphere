### Dependencies

* The following workspace dependencies were updated
  * dependencies
    * noosphere-core bumped from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0
    * noosphere-storage bumped from 0.2.0 to 0.3.0

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/noosphere/compare/noosphere-api-v0.3.0...noosphere-api-v0.4.0) (2022-11-29)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* The `StorageProvider` trait has been replaced by the `Storage` trait. This new trait allows for distinct backing implementations of `BlockStore` and `KeyValueStore`.
* The `.sphere` directory has a new layout; the files previously used to store metadata have been replaced with database metadata; the `blocks` directory is now called `storage`. At this time the easiest migration path is to initialize a new sphere and copy your existing files into it.

### Features

* Re-implement `noosphere-cli` in terms of `noosphere` ([#162](https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/noosphere/issues/162)) ([1e83bbb](https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/noosphere/commit/1e83bbb689642b878f4f6909d7dd4a6df56b29f9))

* Syndicate sphere revisions to IPFS Kubo ([#177](https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/noosphere/issues/177)) ([e269e04](https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/noosphere/commit/e269e0484b73e0f5507406d57a2c06cf849bee3d))

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* Many APIs that previously asked for bare strings when a DID string was expected now expect a newtype called `Did` that wraps a string.

### Features

* `SphereFs` is initialized with key material ([#140](https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/noosphere/issues/140)) ([af48061](https://github.com/subconsciousnetwork/noosphere/commit/af4806114ca8f7703e0a888c7f369a4a4ed69c00))
